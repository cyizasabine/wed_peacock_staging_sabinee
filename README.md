## Project Overview

The **Academic Records Management System (ARMS)** is designed to modernize and simplify the management of academic data within educational institutions. ARMS enhances **efficiency**, **accessibility**, and **data accuracy**, ensuring secure and reliable handling of academic records for all stakeholders, including students, instructors, and administrators.

---

## Problem Statement

### Challenges in Current Systems
- **Manual Management**: Labor-intensive processes prone to delays.
- **Error-Prone Systems**: High risk of data inaccuracies.
- **Limited Scalability**: Inability to meet modern academic needs.

### Proposed Solution
The **Academic Records Management System (ARMS)** offers:
- **Automation**: Streamlined processes for data handling.
- **Centralization**: Unified platform for all academic data.
- **Improved Accessibility**: Role-based access for students, instructors, and administrators.

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Centralized Data Storage**: A unified databases to manage student information, courses, grades, and instructor data.
2. **Role-Based Accessibility**: Secure and transparent access for all stakeholders.
3. **Data Integrity**: Automated processes to maintain accurate and consistent records.
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Tools for academic planning and performance tracking.
